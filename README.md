# Dynamic Web Form

This application is built with native **JavaScript**, **HTML5** and **CSS3**. I have used external JavaScript and CSS files and added referneces of both of the files in index.html.

## Folder Sturcture:

It contains below files/folders:

1. Index.html --> This file contains the **HTML Code** of the apploication.
2. style.css  --> This file contains the **Styling/CSS** for the index.html.
3. script.js  --> This file contains the **javascript code** for the application.
4. README.md  --> This file contains instructions about the application.
5. assets     --> This folder contains the **screenshots** for better understanding of the application.
